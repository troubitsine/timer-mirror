# Timer-Mirror

A focus timer that works by showing you your reflection like a mirror, capturing moments from your work session, and rewarding you with a beautiful highlight reel when you finish.

## What is Timer-Mirror?

Timer-Mirror is a productivity timer app designed to enhance focus and accountability through visual reflection. By showing your own reflection while you work (like looking into a mirror), it creates a natural sense of awareness and presence that helps maintain concentration.

### How it works:

1. **Mirror Effect**: Your front-facing camera creates a live mirror reflection while you work
2. **Session Capture**: The app automatically takes screenshots (desktop) and webcam photos throughout your session  
3. **Highlight Reel**: When you complete your timer, you're rewarded with an animated montage of captured moments - like a small celebration of your focused work

This unique approach combines the psychological benefits of self-awareness with the satisfaction of visual progress tracking, making focus sessions more engaging and rewarding.

## Key Features
